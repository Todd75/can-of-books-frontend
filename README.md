# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Use this template

Clone this repo to your own account with the green "Use this template" button. Then, add any collaborators. Now you are ready to start adding features! Deploy your site to let the world know which books have had the greatest impact on you, and what's recommended. Enjoy!

## Professional Pairing Practice/ Our Agreement

### Logistical

Hours of communication: Open ~ Communication platforms: Slack, Phone ~ Breaks: once an hour ~ Fall behind plan: Donâ€™t worry, ask a TA for help and see if we can fit in some extra time that day or do some work on the weekend.

### Cooperation

Todd's strengths:  CSS, JavaScript, HTML, research skills.  Harper's strengths: JavaScript, React, Node.js, time management, overall planning. The best way to utilize these skills is for Harper to explain the React and Server layout while I type the code and for me to do the same with CSS/FrontEnd while Harper type's the code. Todd needs to improve understanding of passing state and props and React while Harper just needs to improve his CSS layout. We plan to work together for the entirety of the project and pair program so we can learn from each other's strengths.

### Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing:

Since we are pair programming the project this shouldn't be a concern the idea was to capitalize on each other's strengths by explaining to the other while we did it so they could learn and understand the code. If we have that issue for some reason a conversation will be had about it.

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level:

We recognized that and decided to pair program for that reason, because you are only as strong as your weakest team member we tried to learn from each other's skill sets. Plan to ask for help from TA's when stumped and frustration breaks as needed.

## Credit and Collaborations

Button coding for animations was via Codepen from Deerbuck Designing free use code for non-commercial purposes. I used their format and integrated the code then modified it to suit our purposes.

Unsplash.com provided the background image used for books.

Main page background animation via CodePen from Alvaro who had free use code for anyone who follows him. I used his format then integrated and modified the code to suit the changes I wanted in timing.

Footer animation was taken via CodePen from Philip Zastrow free use for anyone. I implimented the code then modified the colors, speed, containers, and rotation angles.
